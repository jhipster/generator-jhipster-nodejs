         * ```
         *      return {
         *          myCustomInitPhaseStep() {
         *              // Do all your stuff here

         *          }
         *      };
         * ```
         *
         * 3. Partially override a phase, this is when the blueprint gets the phase from JHipster and customizes it.
         * ```
         *      const phaseFromJHipster = super._initializing();
         *      const myCustomPhaseSteps = {
         *          displayLogo() {
